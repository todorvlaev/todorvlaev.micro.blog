Turns out - really bad.</p>
<p>The card got corrupted after first use, refused reformatting and repartitioning (only 2/32GB were useable). I managed to salvage the photos from this first photo session - total luck. Btw, not all repair tools are made equal. The macOS built-in <code>fsck</code> didn&rsquo;t do the job, but the one from <code>dosfstools</code> did the trick.</p>
<p>Anyway - don&rsquo;t buy the cheapest card you find from your department store, if you care about what you keep on it that is.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2024/05/10/on-xbox-closing.html">🎮 💻 On Xbox closing down several studios</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2024/05/10/on-xbox-closing.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-05-10 20:15:56 &#43;0300">May 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week’s decision by Xbox to close entire studios stunned me. The nightmare of widespread layoffs in the industry doesn’t seem to seize. I’m disappointed of this particular piece of news for several reasons.</p>
<p><strong>I genuinely root for Xbox’s vision of play anywhere.</strong> Game Pass and demolishing platform exclusives are pro-gamer pillars in their strategy. That said, Game Pass is not all good news for game developers. It can give critical exposure, especially to smaller titles, but in other cases it can also erode sales and thus commercial success. In my region Game Pass for PC goes for 10 euros/month. Considering the library and how often it’s updated it’s an extremely good value - but does it work?</p>
<p><strong>Closing entire studios wipes out whole work cultures.</strong> This is substantially different to e.g. canceling a project, partially reducing workforce or pivoting to a new direction. In these examples, the intangibles of what makes a great team can be largely retained. Closing an entire studio extinguishes something invisible in addition to the business itself.</p>
<p><strong>A sound business decision for Xbox is beyond the scope of a single studio.</strong> This is not a rant against capitalism, it’s not the point. I am disappointed because the studio closures show the worst of having a multi-studio corporate owner, VC or the like. Xbox itself is not Microsoft - citing Microsoft’s overall profit is almost irrelevant. Xbox may derive more value by closing a studio than selling it, e.g because of IP ownership and competition considerations. What hurts is that had the studios been viewed in isolation and with a more fully vested owner they might have been considered viable.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimately, I believe Xbox made the decisions that support its long-term goals best.</strong> Their operating profit based on FTC leaks from last year is in the 10% ballpark. Revenue for Xbox grew only by virtue of the Activition Blizzard acquisition. The gaming industry hasn’t meaningfully grown in the past year and feels very saturated. Clearly, both Arkane Austin, following the Redfall flop, and Tango Gameworks, following Shinji Mikami’s departure, would have a challenging road ahead. I don’t believe the studios were judged only on the basis of their most recent performance. It’s about future outlook and profit appetite.</p>
<p>Taking all into account, I’m still left wondering if the corporations consolidating the gaming industry at the moment are truly building the world game developers and gamers want to see. This is why I’m having such a hard time reconciling this particular blow from Xbox.</p>

			 <p>🎮 Finished Disco Elysium as a confused superstar cop 😎 and a true blue moralist 🤷🏻‍♂️ Happy to have taken a bit different path as it was the second time I picked up the game.

<li>Deep work - thinking and &ldquo;designing&rdquo;</li>

<p>Those were the times. Now we live in a culture of cost efficiency that sacrifices developer experience without batting an eye.

			 <p>📓 Reviewed my weekly takeaways in 2023. Unsurprizingly to me, the themes that emerged are wellbeing, work and career, and productivity. It is also clearly apparent how intertwined they all are. There is enough here to repeat and work on for many years ahead. Here goes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-wellbeing">🪴 Wellbeing</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://commoncog.com/g/burnout/">Burnout symptoms - exhaustion, cynicism, ineffectiveness</a></li>
<li>Hobbies and pursuing interests are effective recovery mechanisms</li>
<li>Messy flat - messy mind</li>
<li>Never too late in the day or week to write a journal entry</li>
<li>Take care of yourself so you can take care of others</li>
<li>At your limits, it is OK to say no and focus on recovery</li>
<li>Poor short-term memory is a symptom of too much stress</li>
<li>Ominous meetings and days are often better than anticipated</li>
<li>Resilience is showing up every day</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-work-and-career">👨‍💻 Work and career</h2>
<ul>
<li>Managing enthusiasm is essential to keeping things simple</li>
<li>Career growth requires crossing the boundaries of your role description</li>
<li>Challenging situations are an opportunity to build skill and improve the status quo</li>
<li>No one is going to remember your work achievements in a year</li>
<li>Know your “chase the fun” and “a place to call home” activities at work for effective recovery</li>
<li>There is no place for guilt in have to take a sick leave</li>
<li>Do not exhaust your &ldquo;complaint budget&rdquo;, i.e. pick your battles</li>
<li>Trust the fundamentals especially when feeling overwhelmed</li>
<li><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/12/12/a-creative-organization.html">The role of leadership is to maintain the necessary tensions and the constructive interaction stemming from them</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-productivity">🤹 Productivity</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/09/08/finally-created-some.html">Scrying your list is useful - “needs to be done today” or ”makes tomorrow easier”</a></li>
<li>Even a single daily journal entry makes it easier to reflect during the weekly review</li>
<li>Returning from vacation in the middle of the work week is a neat recovery trick</li>
<li>Book time for focused work, delegate, work on unique leverage, be kind to yourself</li>
<li>Preparation pays off, think and write, write and think</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-misc">📚 Misc</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making bread requires experimentation - try, learn, improve</li>

			 <p>📓 Iterating over my annual retrospective. Work seems to have a too big effect on how I feel about life. There is a lot to love about 2023, but it’s muted by work at each step.

<p>Because this difference is contextual, any large organization that tries to impose a one-size-fits-all policy is going to fail. The only broad policy that can possibly succeed is one that is flexible based on the needs of the teams and the individuals on that team.</p>

<p>This is a thoughtful article. Made me think even if I have different opinions on some of the default recommendations. My bias is towards the remote-first camp. Yet it&rsquo;s clear as day there isn&rsquo;t one-size-fits-all correct solution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Scrying your TODO list</strong></p>
<p>Scrying is a mechanic from Magic the Gathering tabletop card came. It allows for a player to:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at their stack of cards</li>
<li>decide to put cards at the bottom of the stack</li>
<li>decide to keep cards on the top and re-order them</li>
</ul>
<p>Scrying your TODO list could be a useful metaphor for prioritizing tasks. The order of tasks, especially the next 2-5 tasks, is more important than completing the whole list.</p>
<p>A useful heuristic for scrying a TODO list is deciding which tasks need doing today and which tasks will make tomorrow easier.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/08/18/lenovo-yoga-arb.html">💾 Lenovo Yoga 7 14ARB7 - Good riddance!</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/08/18/lenovo-yoga-arb.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-08-18 00:24:21 &#43;0300">Aug 18, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>TLDR; Lenovo Yoga 7 14ARB7 is hot garbage, buy a Mac</p>
<p>I need to preface this “review” with something. I’m grateful for the privilege to not be worried about my finances currently. I’m deeply aware because I have been worried in the past. So, when I get something new - I need it, I’m passionate about it, I see the positives, overlook the negatives, assume good intentions.</p>
<p>So when I spend a non-negligable amount of money on something that disappoints me as thoroughly as the Yoga 7, I get… angry.</p>
<p>The prelude - we need a new laptop in the household, the Macbook Air 2017 with its horrible display doesn’t cut it anymore. So I see a “back-to-school” kind of offer on the Yoga 7. Hm, OK, a recent mobile AMD APU, 16GB DDR5 6400MHz RAM, 512 GB PCIe4 SSD - should be fine. In addition 2800x1800px resolution with an OLED, convertible laptop-tablet mode, 90Hz refresh rate - I’m excited. Won’t beat my iPad Pro 2020 in terms of writing/drawing experience but should be decent as an added bonus and the Yoga should beat the iPad, not to mention the the Macbook Air, at colors and smoothness of the image. This is what is on paper - an attractive spec, substantial upgrade for, say, half the price of what I would otherwise get if I was looking at Macs.</p>
<p>Online reviews were scarce, as the model seems to not be available in all regions, especially not in the States. Still, did some research, looked promising and disregarded some warning signs I thought of as anecdotal. After all, there is always someone with a defective device, or a skewed personal opinion… Here is mine.</p>
<p>Did you get excited about the “beautiful 2.8k OLED display” reviews and marketing materials talk about? Hot garbage because of the touch layer. There were extremely visible artefacts already during installation, especially on bright backgrounds. I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, after all the display is a highlight of this product. After some extra research I believe what I was seeing was the touch capacitive layer matrix… apparently somewhat common with OLED touch displays according to the Internet. How does this pass quality control and any sane product designers is beyond me. The combination is not fit for purpose and especially not when you add an otherwise gorgeous high-resolution OLED panel. It makes me weep thinking about it. Strike 1.</p>
<p>The usual Windows (11) crap kicks in - a barrage of updates. Fans are loud, I’m not worried. After a couple of hours of updates, Windows and Lenovo drivers, the background activity should get quiet. The fans, turns out, not so. With barely any activity on the device the fans spin up, even in the save battery mode. Googling more about a potential root cause and solutions… Found a Reddit thread I can’t be bothered to site but that matches my observations. The fans are not controlled by temperature but by wattage! Fan Control, well… didn’t find controls for the fans because of this. E.g. Temps are at 40-50C across the board in light usage, while all along fans are spinning based on the Watts and not temps. Strike 2.</p>
<p>Performance. Well, not impressive. For all the APU and DDR5 RAM buzz, the experience is not nearly as snappy as on my desktop with technically lower specs. I should say I’m happy with my Windows 11 experience on the desktop. Several temporary freezes, and extremely clumsy “tablet” mode (note, I wasn’t even expecting it to be close to an iPad)… Strike 3.</p>
<p>If this is not enough. While otherwise the build quality was good and I was willing to neglect that the touchpad is not nearly as good as, say, my MBP 16” work laptop… the F2 button on the keyboard was defective, pops out as if close to detaching in normal use. Bad luck, but… Strike “I’m not counting anymore”.</p>
<p>Can’t fix much either - fan control, APU performance tuning and BIOS settings are severely limited.</p>
<p>So, packed this buddy back in the box and returned it… may have to forfeit 30% of the cost for this nightmare of an evening with a defective and poorly designed Lenovo (Windows) product that retails in the 1000-1400 EUR range. No one deserves to spend this amount of their hard-earned cash to be let down like this, it’s frankly a borderline scam.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whatever gripes I may have with Macs sometimes… I’ve used heavily just 2 Mac laptops in the last 9 years! If the Mac annoys you occasionally - remember it’s scary out there with the Windows OEMs. I’ll probably try again in 10 years.</p>
<p>End of rant.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/01/15/the-callisto-protocol.html">🎮 The Callisto Protocol - better than the reviews, but still…</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2023/01/15/the-callisto-protocol.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-15 13:16:17 &#43;0300">Jan 15, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had been eagerly waiting for the release of <a href="https://callisto.sds.com/">The Callisto Protocol</a> in the end of 2022. From the minds of Dead Space creators, Callisto is a spiritual successor to this survival horror classic. I have to be honest - maybe too much so. After the first couple of hours, I felt that there wasn&rsquo;t enough of a novelty to have justified my pre-order. Nor to back up claims such as bringing survival horror to the 2020s. This remains a fair warning.</p>
<p>That said, Callisto is an extremely well crafted and high quality cinematic experience. As I kept immersing myself in the world of the game, my initial sense of disappointment diminished. Still, I feel the development team overestimated the novelty of the close combat system. It is, however, really satisfying once you embrace its way of creating flow. If this was paired with a more captivating story, it would have taken the game to the next level. Alas, it is what it is.</p>
<p>Gameplay won&rsquo;t appeal to many, but chances are if you are Dead Space fan - you&rsquo;d be fulfilled. Progression is linear, encounters scripted with little left to chance. This is perfectly fine, I enjoyed pre-planning and experimenting with difficult encounters, alongside improving my command of controls. Speaking of controls, there are a few rough edges around weapon swapping but it really forces you to remain composed and intentional under pressure.</p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m very happy with The Callisto Protocol and can absolutely recommend it. Seeing the level of polish of its visuals and fusion of cinematics with combat, it&rsquo;s frustrating the whole package has some flaws that keep the game in the &ldquo;Great&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Hall of Fame&rdquo; category.</p>

<p>Every day, no matter how successful we become, we need to earn our success. We need to be kind and appreciative; we need to surround ourselves with people who will push back on us and question our beliefs and actions. We need to demonstrate humility. You are never more susceptible to a huge mistake than right after a big win, when you begin to believe the falsehood that your success is all about you. Yes, you’re brilliant and hardworking, but greatness is in the agency of others, and timing (and other features of luck) is everything.</p>

			 <p>Had someone asked me 10 minutes in, I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought <a href="http://rose-engine.org/signalis/">Signalis</a> would have grasped me the way it did. Some of my favorite games of my childhood are of the likes of Resident Evil 3 and Silent Hill. Signalis inescapably reminds me of the retro survival horror classics. The game is true to its inspirations down to the sometimes clumsy mechanics and restrictions, such as no autosaves.</p>
<p>The magnetic draw of the game, however, is far deeper than its aesthetics. The whole narrative design in my opinion is outstanding. Signalis is a true tribute to indie craftsmanship. The core game team of the <a href="http://rose-engine.org">rose-engine</a> is 2 people and the care put into the game seeps through its every pore.</p>
<p>Writing this as I just finished my run, I feel deeply satisfied with my experience. The puzzles were generally simple, yet not insultingly so. There is, of course, action in the game but far from the spotlight. The limited inventory, enforces resource scarcity even when things are good. Everything just works together, as you get sucked in the tense mystic atmosphere. And at least I feel fully rewarded for my time and attention.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for a while now to take a long weekend. Finally, there was the perfect opportunity and I decided to make the most of it. Of course, this means making a list. I&rsquo;ve checked the items below. I&rsquo;m proud I managed to tick everything off, apart from ❌ taking a nap. Will catch up during the weekend 😉.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I decided to ✅ walk everywhere I go on Friday, to keep me active and, well, I enjoy walking a lot. My first destination in the morning was a cozy cafe, where I had a solid breakfast set. It was super chill, I was the only customer for the most of the hour I spent there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After breakfast, on to ✅ Helsinki&rsquo;s City Library Oodi. The Finnish library system is some sort of a welfare utopia, Oodi is the cherry on top of the cake. On the way, ✅ listened to a podcast, <a href="https://www.game-production.com/podcast/episode/4b0f679b/a-day-in-the-life-of-producers-panel">a panel discussion on the day in the life of game producers</a>. At the library I ✅ finished the draft of a blog post, read some magazines, had some tea and overall was sucking in the unique atmosphere of Oodi.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nothing relaxes me like ✅ a good sauna session. It was a bit early in the day, this was a bit of a challenge. Settled for Allas, which is in the heart of the city and combined it with some open air swimming (in a heated pool). There was also the option to dip in a pool of actual sea water, however the water temperature of 8 degrees Celsius, discouraged me… but not many of the other customers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the way to an early dinner, I made an improptu stop by one of my favorite beer pubs - <a href="https://pien.fi/en/">Pien</a>. This pint of Czech Pilsner brought to a spring to my step as I commuted to my next destination.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>✅ Dinner at a lovely wine and tapas bar with my partner. Excellent food, drinks and, of course, company 🥰.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We had a nightcap on the way home in the tiniest of wine bars. Super atmospheric. By then, I was feeling the nice tinge of exhaustion from a long day well spent. 🙏</p>

<p>As professionals we often put ourselves in other people&rsquo;s shoes. Be it customers, peers, managers. We benefit from empathy and critical thinking. I like playing devil&rsquo;s advocate. This often requires challenging own core beliefs.</p>
<p>Many of us are blessed with working with a team of smart people. And smart people are darn difficult to argue with. They have good arguments and often juxtaposed valid perspectives. Navigating this sometimes requires (😱) changing our own minds.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few ideas I&rsquo;ve come across recently that have challenged some common beliefs core to my work. Have fun.</p>
<h2 id="we-may-not-need-teams-anymore">We may not need teams anymore</h2>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2022/04/do-we-still-need-teams">HBR: Do We Still Need Teams?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we’ve stated in <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/06/the-secrets-of-great-teamwork">past research</a>, true teams have a shared mindset, a compelling joint mission, defined roles, stable membership, high interdependence, and clear norms.  Co-acting groups represent a loose confederation of employees who dip in and out of collaborative interactions as a project or initiative unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of the notion of &ldquo;dynamic teams&rdquo; I read about in uni. It&rsquo;s startling to say that we don&rsquo;t need teams. And it&rsquo;s also not quite like that. There are some interesting benefits, though. Co-acting groups band and disband rapidly based on desired outcomes. I&rsquo;d venture that start-ups are much better at this than larger corporations. There is potential of making disruptive re-orgs a thing of the past. Co-acting groups, or dynamic work comunities, are an enviable organizational capability.</p>
<h2 id="the-open-office-is-not-great-for-workers">The open office is not great for workers</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/opinion/open-plan-office-awful.html">NYT: Opinion | The Immortal Awfulness of Open Plan Workplaces</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For decades, research has found that open plan offices are bad for companies, bad for workers, bad for health and bad for morale. And yet they just won’t die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit this something that&rsquo;s not new to me, ever since <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/peopleware-productive-projects/9780133440706/"><em>Peopleware</em></a> at least.  Yet, I also understand the challenges that drive us towards the open space multi-func spaces of today. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and we need to be respectful of this. However when was the last time your company experimented with private offices. (I&rsquo;m not laughing, you are laughing. 😀)</p>
<h2 id="objectives-and-metrics-may-prevent-us-from-achieving-our-higher-goals">Objectives and metrics may prevent us from achieving our higher goals</h2>
<p><a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/kenneth-stanley/">Kenneth Stanley: Set The Right Objectives [The Knowledge Project Ep. #148]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually the subjective judgments are the interesting ones because the objective judgments are easy. You don’t need a degree to just measure something.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Objectives and metrics may restrict the required creativity when dealing with complex problems. Our good-intentioned drive for objectivity can also trip us up. Subjective judgements and experiences are super valuable. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t improve what you don&rsquo;t measure.&rdquo;&hellip; Really?? I beg to differ. By the way, I&rsquo;m an active participant and proponent of rolling out OKRs in our organization. It definitely helps to keep the hype in check.</p>

			 <p>It is a common notion that a manager&rsquo;s most important job is protecting their team from distractions. It popped up recently in a conversation with a teammate who thought I&rsquo;m doing it well. This triggered me in 2 ways. First, I&rsquo;m not actively shielding the team from anything. Second, I&rsquo;ve always found this idea at odds with transparency and empowerment.</p>
<p>The key point to make here is that a change of perspective can achieve better results. Consider a shift from filtering noise to enabling working systems. By another common saying, the product of a team&rsquo;s manager is their team. Instead of being a local shield, a manager can achieve positive network effects in the wider organization by improving the system, i.e. ways of working.</p>
<p>There is indeed a problem to solve. The cognitive demands on anyone in a highly connected workplace can be overwhelming. Therefore, a manager benefits from high tolerance to uncertainty. And their focus should be on helping the team make sense of the world. The firehose of information could be available to most in a company. The way for a manager to bring value is to give their take on a cohesive narrative.</p>
<p>In summary, instead of being a shield to your team - be a sense-maker and enabler for the whole organization.</p>

			 <p>🎮 The Ascent: only short of a masterpiece</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_(video_game)">The Ascent</a> recently and I&rsquo;ve been enjoying it a lot. It&rsquo;s a memorable, satisfying twin-stick shooter - RPG cross. I highly recommend it! Still, it&rsquo;s not a hall-of-fame masterpiece and I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on why. I have nothing but admiration for the small (10 people or so) development team that managed to pull off this fantastic production!</p>
<p>The game world is beautifully crafted! This <a href="https://youtu.be/FodXp5BkENk">GDC talk by Tor Frick</a>, was a pleasure to watch! <a href="https://www.neongiant.se">Neon Giant</a> took a disciplined approach to simplicity, powered by practical specialized tools to ensure consistency with the art direction at all times. The end result of the team&rsquo;s effort is a stunning neon-colored sci-fi haven. I felt as if I&rsquo;m in the world of the Neuromancer. The action is satisfying, the items, enemies and quests - plentiful.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s missing… Ten hours in, which is reasonably much for me, I still don&rsquo;t feel hooked to the main story and this is unlikely to change. What brings me back is the world aesthetic as a whole.</p>
<p>While there is an impressive amount of weapons and items, I feel I&rsquo;ve quickly converged on a build and skill leveling strategy. I may be wrong, but I don&rsquo;t get the feeling I can play the game in a substantially different way. That said I&rsquo;ve watched some streamers with distinct styles of their own.</p>
<p>The Ascent is a bit glitchy on my Xbox Series S - I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve had any other game on this console crash on me as often. But it&rsquo;s nothing that ruins my gaming experience. This is one area, perhaps, where it shows it wasn&rsquo;t the biggest team making the game. Overall performance is quite good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to future productions by Neon Giant. The Ascent is an amazing, if not outstanding, gaming experience. I haven&rsquo;t tried its multiplayer, but if this is your cup of tea - I imagine it delivers. I feel the game&rsquo;s elusive shortcomings won&rsquo;t see me complete the main story… and this is weirdly disappointing already.</p>

			 <p>💻 What better way to spend Sunday evening&hellip; than to fiddle with cross-posting to LinkedIn. 🙃 In this iteration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> picks up the new post from the blog category RSS feed</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> sends to a <a href="buffer.com">Buffer</a> queue</li>
<li><a href="https://buffer.com">Buffer</a> will eventually post to LinkedIn based on its schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>Curious how images and links will perform through the pipeline. If it works, this would be neat as Buffer would add an extra level of control. However, it&rsquo;a annoying and complicated to have so many tools in the process. At least, this all should work with the free tiers.</p>

			 <p>💻🎙 <a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project-podcast/marshall-goldsmith/">Marshall Goldsmith: The Essentials Of Leadership [The Knowledge Project Ep. #142]</a></p>
<p>Happened to listen to this podcast episode again &ldquo;by mistake&rdquo; today. It packs a lot of wisdom on leadership and coaching. Too much to process on a single listen. It was easy to just let it play once I realized what it was. Some personal highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you want to change be rigorous about follow-up</li>
<li>you can make an idea 5% better by providing your input but diminish the commitment of others by 50%</li>
<li>breathe, let it go</li>
<li>never start a sentence with &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;but&rdquo;, &ldquo;however&rdquo;</li>
<li>never base your value as a human on actual outcomes; do your best</li>
<li>we are here to make a positive difference in the world, not to prove how right or smart we are</li>

			<h1><a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2022/08/22/a-burnout-guide.html">💻 A burnout guide for managers incl. brief annotations</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://microblog.todor.cc/2022/08/22/a-burnout-guide.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-22 23:08:56 &#43;0300">Aug 22, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently read an overall excellent <a href="https://commoncog.com/g/burnout/">guide on burnout</a> for managers. Here&rsquo;s a few of my key take-aways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burnout is a psychological state caused by prolonged stress from a job.</p>
<p>There are three key characteristics of burnout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overwhelming exhaustion.</li>
<li>Feelings of cynicism.</li>
<li>And a sense of ineffectiveness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The above characteristics could manifest in different combinations. Also the intensity could be distributed unevenly. This was illustrated well in the stories in the guide. I suppose, ultimately, burnout incapacitates us beyond a sense of ineffectiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>burnout is really a ‘stress experience within a social environment’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burnout occurs in the context of one’s environment. People have different responses and levels of resilience. It is, however, unfair to put the full responsibility of burning out onto the individual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The JD-R model classifies every occupation into two general categories: job demands and job resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This model of looking at the problem is simple. I like it because it intuitively feels as first principles. Managers can affect the context in which potential burnout occurs by affecting the job demands and job resources. This is the balancing act of every team manager. What resources can be made available for people such that we can cope with high job demands?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the bad news: we know very little about recovering from burnout. What we do know are two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual interventions don’t work — and by individual interventions we mean interventions while the person continues to be at the workplace that caused the burnout.</li>
<li>If you remove yourself from that working environment, you will recover.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The second point is crucial. Something needs to change and it doesn&rsquo;t mean a person needs to resign. It means adapting or changing the role of the individual significantly enough so that they can recover. You can&rsquo;t expect that a person will just regain their step in the same environment that led them to burn out in the first place.</p>
<p>An aspect I would have wished for the guide to cover is circumstances outside of work. There is no deficit of what to worry about on an any given day. The pandemic, war, climate crisis… all cause substantial anxiety in the lives of many of us. In that sense, factors outside of the work place also could contribute to burnout.</p>
<p>Remember to replenish your resources.</p>

			 <p>This post will be shortly sent to <a href="mailto:support@feedbin.com">support@feedbin.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here goes as per <a href="https://feedbin.com/help/making-a-feature-request/">Feedbin’s feature request instructions</a>:</p>
<p><strong>1️⃣ Sell it! Why would this make a good feature?</strong></p>
<p>Feedbin  already has excellent Micro.blog integration! 🙏 With just a few bits of improvements, including this one, Feedbin can practically replace the native app. This makes it more likely for Feedbin to become the one place to consume content from.</p>
<p>The request is to add a direct link to the Micro blog converstion, alongside the Thread view. This feature would:</p>
<ul>
<li>make the UX more consistent with the Twitter integration</li>
<li>eliminate friction by reducing app switching</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2️⃣ Good features should appeal to many. Not just you.</strong></p>
<p>Micro.blog is also a community formed around conversations. People interact daily on the platform. Some of us find a feed reader the best way to catch up with posts (see this <a href="https://miraz.me/2022/07/30/after-a-few.html">post</a>, and its <a href="https://micro.blog/Miraz/13204864">conversation</a>).  Not all are Feedbin users, but those who are will love a better integration.</p>
<p><strong>3️⃣ How do you envision the feature would work? Use descriptions, mock-ups whatever helps communicate your vision.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4️⃣ Most of the time the hardest part of any feature is building an interface for it, so extra points if you can help out with that.</strong></p>
<p>Combining 3️⃣&amp; 4️⃣. Let&rsquo;s take a Twitter post example, as in the screenshot below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Micro.blog integration could work in similar fashion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message bubble icon <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  would open the Thread in Feedbin, as it works already now</li>
<li>The service icon <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  would open the external link to the conversation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5️⃣ Above all contributing code is the best way to get a feature started.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, no can do. 🙂</p>

			 <p>This post will be shortly sent to <a href="mailto:support@feedbin.com">support@feedbin.com</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure if this may be classified as an issue, but here goes as per <a href="https://feedbin.com/help/making-a-feature-request/">Feedbin&rsquo;s feature request instructions</a>:</p>
<p><strong>1️⃣ Sell it! Why would this make a good feature?</strong></p>
<p>Feedbin  already has excellent Micro.blog integration! 🙏 With just a few bits of improvements, including this one, Feedbin can practically replace the native app. This makes it more likely for Feedbin to become the one place to consume content from.</p>
<p>Showing images/thumbnails is fairly standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>helps to read micro posts faster, no need to even open the entry</li>
<li>makes the list of entries prettier</li>
<li>many other feeds, incl. 🐦 Twitter support image thumbnails</li>
</ul>
<p>This request particularly refers to the Discover and Timeline type of feeds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://micro.blog/posts/discover</code></li>
<li><code>https://micro.blog/feeds/username.json</code>, e.g. mine being <code>https://micro.blog/feeds/todor.json</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2️⃣ Good features should appeal to many. Not just you.</strong></p>
<p>The Discover and personal Timeline feeds are the core feeds on Micro.blog. I bet users spent most of their time on these feeds. This feature will improve the experience for every Micro.blog user.</p>
<p><strong>3️⃣ How do you envision the feature would work? Use descriptions, mock-ups whatever helps communicate your vision.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4️⃣ Most of the time the hardest part of any feature is building an interface for it, so extra points if you can help out with that.</strong></p>
<p>Combining 3️⃣ &amp; 4️⃣. The attached images show the difference between the Discover feed and the blog&rsquo;s direct JSON feed. The thumbnail is showed in the blog&rsquo;s feed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The feature request is essentially to have the thumbnail visible for entries that utilize the Micro.blog integration as well.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/todorvlaev/ffd6e51f7b89851f30b84554a024ea32">gist with a snapshot of the Discover feed</a>. Relevant part:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been rebuilding my RSS reader setup over the last few days and I&rsquo;m loving it. I was an avid Google Reader user (RIP) back in the day. After its demise I switched over to newsletters, except for a minor flirt with <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>. Newsletters hardly ever worked for me as I&rsquo;m not email-oriented at all. Some posts on <a href="https://micro.blog">✴️ Micro.blog</a> inspired me to check again the state of RSS readers and I&rsquo;m super excited about what I found. Nowadays, I would call them feed readers - there are more options than RSS and this is amazing - JSON, Atom, email (!), podcasts, and I suppose some custom integrations.</p>
<p>After exploring several options I settled for <a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a>. <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, while refreshingly straightforward, felt insufficient for my needs. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t remember the details anymore after so much digging and comparing. I may still return to them in the future. The last contender was <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/language/english">Inoreader</a>. It has a dazzling amount of options, so many as to confuse you in the beginning. Yet, most of the configurability was cruft to me, and the one thing I found useful for viewing didn&rsquo;t have feature parity on iPad. I can&rsquo;t stress how much it annoys me when the mobile apps are too crippled vs web.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the top things I appreciated in <a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a>, mixed with my workflow preferences:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aesthetics</strong> The app is sleek-looking and current. If I&rsquo;m to stick with a reader, aesthetics are not a superficial requirement. I&rsquo;m giving up the curated design of many services. I should like what I look at.</li>
<li><strong>Fetching full content</strong> Feeds are often truncated. <a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a> does a stunning job at fetching the full content. It&rsquo;s also a persistent setting per feed. So it works seamlessly. E.g. <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/language/english">Inoreader</a> required one extra click every time. Added bonus is how all the ads and useless elements get stripped away.</li>
<li><strong>Mute</strong> I&rsquo;m an inbox 0 person. Unread counts stress me a lot. For the highest volume feeds, mainly news-type, I just mute the feeds. In any case, I read news on-demand even now. <a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a> gives you stats for feed volume which simplifies managing this.</li>
<li><strong>Micro.blog integration</strong> This is very important to me currently. There is excellent integration - you can even read the whole conversation from within <a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a>. One thing that is lacking is a direct link to the conversation for ease of replying. A feature request is on my list.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://feedbin.com/">🍔 Feedbin</a> is not after my data</strong> From what I can tell the app is maintained by a small team of 2. There is no magic algorithm, suggestions, ads, i.e. suspicious intelligence. Furthermore, the project is <a href="https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin">open source</a>, though it&rsquo;s not recommended to run your own instance. And even then, no one is stopping you - just don&rsquo;t expect official support.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been steadily migrating what I follow from a zillion of places to the feed reader - email, bookmarks, Twitter, Medium. It&rsquo;s been extremely smooth. Only in one case I needed to use a feed generator (<a href="http://fetchrss.com/">FetchRSS</a>), yet to see if this works well enough - but, hey, there is this option for stubborn sites, too.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Hope someone found something useful. If you have any tips, hit me up 🙏</p>

			 <p>💾❓🍔 Feedbin + ✴️ Micro.blog query. There is already pretty nice integration. Only thing lacking is interaction. Is it possible to reply to a conversation directly from Feedbin? If not, is there an easy way to navigate to the conversation as to reply from Micro.blog?</p>
