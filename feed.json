I’m grateful for the privilege to not be worried about my finances currently. I’m deeply aware because I have been worried in the past.

So I see a “back-to-school” kind of offer on the Yoga 7. Hm, OK, a recent mobile AMD APU, 16GB DDR5 6400MHz RAM, 512 GB PCIe4 SSD - should be fine. In addition 2800x1800px resolution with an OLED, convertible laptop-tablet mode, 90Hz refresh rate - I’m excited. Won’t beat my iPad Pro 2020 in terms of writing/drawing experience but should be decent as an added bonus and the Yoga should beat the iPad, not to mention the the Macbook Air, at colors and smoothness of the image.

After all, there is always someone with a defective device, or a skewed personal opinion… Here is mine.</p>\n<p>Did you get excited about the “beautiful 2.8k OLED display” reviews and marketing materials talk about? Hot garbage because of the touch layer. There were extremely visible artefacts already during installation, especially on bright backgrounds. I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, after all the display is a highlight of this product. After some extra research I believe what I was seeing was the touch capacitive layer matrix… apparently somewhat common with OLED touch displays according to the Internet.

The combination is not fit for purpose and especially not when you add an otherwise gorgeous high-resolution OLED panel. It makes me weep thinking about it. Strike 1.</p>\n<p>The usual Windows (11) crap kicks in - a barrage of updates. Fans are loud, I’m not worried. After a couple of hours of updates, Windows and Lenovo drivers, the background activity should get quiet. The fans, turns out, not so. With barely any activity on the device the fans spin up, even in the save battery mode. Googling more about a potential root cause and solutions… Found a Reddit thread I can’t be bothered to site but that matches my observations. The fans are not controlled by temperature but by wattage! Fan Control, well… didn’t find controls for the fans because of this. E.g. Temps are at 40-50C across the board in light usage, while all along fans are spinning based on the Watts and not temps. Strike 2.</p>\n<p>Performance. Well, not impressive. For all the APU and DDR5 RAM buzz, the experience is not nearly as snappy as on my desktop with technically lower specs. I should say I’m happy with my Windows 11 experience on the desktop. Several temporary freezes, and extremely clumsy “tablet” mode (note, I wasn’t even expecting it to be close to an iPad)… Strike 3.</p>\n<p>If this is not enough. While otherwise the build quality was good and I was willing to neglect that the touchpad is not nearly as good as, say, my MBP 16” work laptop… the F2 button on the keyboard was defective, pops out as if close to detaching in normal use.

Instead of being a local shield, a manager can achieve positive network effects in the wider organization by improving the system, i.e. ways of working.\n\nThere is indeed a problem to solve. The cognitive demands on anyone in a highly connected workplace can be overwhelming. Therefore, a manager benefits from high tolerance to uncertainty. And their focus should be on helping the team make sense of the world. The firehose of information could be available to most in a company. The way for a manager to bring value is to give their take on a cohesive narrative.\n\nIn summary, instead of being a shield to your team - be a sense-maker and enabler for the whole organization.\n\nPhoto by [Jonathan Allison](https://unsplash.com/@jallison154).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/f4f4c71842.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Roundabout\" title=\"Roundabout\" description=\"Roundabout view from top.\">\n\n",
